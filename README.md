# Social_Opinion
An Android front end that pulls data from an AWS s3 bucket of which is placed there via a Python script using NLTK on Twitter data.

The ‘Social Opinion’ app pulls data from an AWS S3 bucket that has been created using Natural Language Processing techniques. The data is taken from a snapshot of Twitter posts (every hour or so) and NLP is used to derive the sentiment (positive or negative). The result of this is what we can see above with a division of positive tweets over the total.
